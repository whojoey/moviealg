<h1 class="title">Journey to Find an adequate Movie Profit Prediction</h1>
<h2 class="desc">The Countless Hours we spent to finally realize that this was harder than we thought.</h2>
<img src="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/the-room-tommy-625x352.jpg">

<p><b>Aim</b>: Our goal was to discover and create an algorithm that could predict if a future movie
    will be profitable. </p>

<p><b>Data Source</b>: The main data source was a .csv file pulled from Kaggle. It had over 5000 movies.
    Furthermore, we pulled more data from both online sources Movie Database and OMDB. We also
    implemented the ability to add movies manually to the database.</p>

<p><b>Features:</b> The original feature list were split in 2 CSV with the following features:

    <section><h2>tmdb_5000_movies:</h2>
        <br>budget,genres,homepage,id,keywords,original_language,original_title,overview,popularity,production_companies,
        production_countries,release_date,revenue,runtime,spoken_languages,status,tagline,title,vote_average,vote_count</br>
    </section>

    <section><h2>tmdb_5000_credits:</h2>
        <br>movie_id,title,cast (JSON list), crew(JSON list)</br>
    </section>

    <section>
<p> We ended combining the 2 CSVs files into 1 CSV. The final feature list is as follows:
<ul class = "joeUl"><li class = "Cam">index</li><li class = "Cam">budget</li><li class = "Cam">genres</li><li class = "Cam">original_title</li><li class = "Cam">popularity</li><li class = "Cam">release_date</li><li class = "Cam">revenue</li><li class = "Cam">runtime</li><li class = "Cam">vote_average</li><li class = "Cam">vote_count</li><li class = "Cam">IMDB</li><li class = "Cam">rotten</li><li class = "Cam">metaC</li><li class = "Cam">cast</li><li class = "Cam">crew</li></ul></p>
</section>

<p><b>Output:</b> The final result would be an estimation of the approximate revenue of what this movie will bring in.

<h1 class="title">What Happened?</h1>

<p>After finding a data source to work with, we went to work cleaning the data. We parsed some data such as eliminating columns
    of JSON. We eliminated outliers or rows where there was blank fields or fields where there were extreme outliers. We also
    removed fields that had 0 budget in making movies.</p>

<p>We split the responsibilities between building the linear prediction algorithm and deployment and frontend design. Jamahl and Joseph
    worked on seeing if they could manipulate data using Python. Joseph has some experience with databases and data analysis but no experience
    with Python. Jamahl had little to no experience with Python and databases. Jae had a lot of experience with Web Frameworks, Front end design
    and application deployment.</p>


<p><b>Linear Regression:</b> We were able to use what we learned in class to begin the process of linear regression. </p>

<p>We also took a slight detour where created a script that added all the reviews for all 5000 movies. The review sources
    are from Rotten Tomatoes, MetaCritic and IMDB. We did this to find if there was a relationship between the reviews and movie success.
Unfortunately, the work was for naught as we found no correlation between the reviews and movie success. </p>


<h2>Correlation</h2>
{{corr | safe}}

<br>

<img src="../static/img/analysis.png" width="1000" height="1000">

<p>
<h2>Please pick the independent variable to model:</h2>
<span class = em>'budget', 'popularity', 'runtime', 'vote_count', 'monthFact', 'actorFact', 'genFact', 'vote_average', 'IMDB', 'rotten', 'metaC'</span>
<form method="POST" id="corr"><br><input type="text" id ="indep" placeholder="Independent Variable">
    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Submit</button>
</form>
</p>

<div id="display"  style="display:none;"></div>
<div id="fucked" style="display:none;"></div>


<p>Our conclusion from this is that there were 3 obscure columns that correlated with higher revenue in movies:
    <ul class="joeUL"> <li class="Cam">Budget</li><li class="Cam">Popularity</li><li class="Cam">Vote Count</li></ul></p>

<p><b>Budget:</b> This is pretty self explanatory and somewhat logical as the higher the budget then there is a correlation that there is
higher return.</p>

<p><b>Popularity:</b> This metric is actually measured by the TMDB (The Movie Database website). So on their website, they measure
the number of votes for day, number of views for the day, number of users mark the movie as "favorite" for the day, number of users
who added it to their "watchlist" for the day, release date, number of total votes and the previous days score.</p>

<p><b>Vote Count:</b> The vote count means there is a correlation between the vote count on the TMDB web page and the predicted
movie success.</p>


<p>After analysis, we found that the P-Value of each of these were not adequate for analysis. The final graph for the Expected vs Calculated
Results also showed a lack of correlation. </p>

    <p>The next step is to search out for a NonLinear Relationship. We looked for a NonLinear solution hoping for a better result.</p>

<p><b>NonLinear Approach</b> The NonLinear approach we referenced a website called apmonitor which had an example of
    <a href="http://apmonitor.com/me575/index.php/Main/NonlinearRegression">NonLinear Regression.</a></p>


<img src="data:image/png;base64,{{ nonLinGraph }}" width="800">

<p><b>Star Actors/Actresses</b> We were able to pull the data on actors and actresses and specifically their earning power.
The process on how we determined this is by count of how many movies they did and also the factor of how much revenue.
These 2 factors together allowed us to determine the cutoff on Actors and Actresses. However, we found that there
was very little correlation on Actors/Actresses and Revenue. We confirmed this by marking the top 40 actors/actresses
and then checking for a correlation.</p>


<img src="data:image/png;base64,{{ actorG }}" width="1000">

    <b>actor revenue</b>
    <br>Tom Cruise  8463932810
    <br>Ian McKellen  8226444997
     <br> Robert Downey Jr.  8192023846
     <br>Johnny Depp  8040226865
    <br>Tom Hanks  7852031825


<p><b>Genres</b> We were able to determine similarly which Genres are most popular. We took the Popularity metric on TMDB
and then did an average of the popularity and also factored in the amount of time the genre popped up on the database.

We then went back into the Database and marked off the the Top 5 in the database.
</p>

<img src="data:image/png;base64,{{ genrePop }}" width="1000">
    <b>genre  popularity</b>
    <br>Adventure   47.856634
    <br>Animation   47.795233
    <br>Science Fiction   44.961127
    <br>Fantasy   44.328318
    <br>Action   38.781424


<p><b>Release Months</b> We also did a study on Release Dates and specifically months. We used the relationship between
month and revenue and found that May, July and August were the best months to release a movie. Then we marked any movie
with those months as a study for correlation.</p>
